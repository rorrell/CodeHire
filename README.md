# CodeHire
A C# MVC/Web API job searching app

This is done using Code First Entity Framework as well as MVC and Web API.

Primary goal is for people to be able to search by language because I couldn't find that in any existing app.  Currently has the ability to View/Search and manage jobs (managing is for users with special priviliges), as well as the ability for job seekers to apply for jobs by hitting the apply button and then view the jobs they have applied for.
